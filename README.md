# SearchVisual
a searching visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This interactive application allows you to see how different searching algorithms work on different datasets.
To use the searching visualizer, simply enter a search term and the algorithm you want to use. The visualizer will then animate the search process, showing you how the algorithm compares your search term to the elements in the dataset.
